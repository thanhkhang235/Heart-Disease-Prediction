# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This is the final project in Machine Learning course, with the purpose of predicting heart disease

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient will experience a lethal outcome due to heart disease. The prediction is made using data available by the end of the third day, ensuring that all input features are considered for accurate classification.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to classify the lethal outcome (cause) of heart disease patients using a given dataset. The prediction is made using various steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and model evaluation.

## Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Rebalancing data using SMOTE

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of key features.
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Understand class distributions and feature importance.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify and select relevant features based on their importance using Recursive Feature Elimination and Correlation Heatmap

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train various classification models to predict the lethal outcome.
   - Use algorithms such as Decision Tree and XGBoots.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
